Note:
    
For rank-deficient data such as EEG data after average reference or interpolation, 
it is recommended to reduce the dimensionality 
(by 1 for average reference and 1 for each interpolated channel) 
for optimal ICA performance

Note to self: Think of number of components that is good for ICA!
You can think of making it 24 because 6 will be max number of channel excluded 
if you exclude subject with 20% bad chans. (31 - 1 for average - 6 for interpolated max.)

RuntimeWarning: 
    
The provided ICA instance was fitted with a 'fastica' algorithm. 
ICLabel was designed with extended infomax ICA decompositions. 
To use the extended infomax algorithm, use the 'mne.preprocessing.ICA' instance with the arguments 
'ICA(method='infomax', fit_params=dict(extended=True))' (scikit-learn) or 
'ICA(method='picard', fit_params=dict(ortho=False, extended=True))' (python-picard).

Note: 
Look into find_bads_ecg() method of ICA....

# #### Get mixing matrix 
# ###The mixing_matrix obtained here represents the weights applied to each sensor channel to obtain the independent components. 
# ###Each row of the mixing matrix corresponds to one independent component, and each column corresponds to one sensor channel.

# mixing_matrix = ica.get_components()

# # The mixing matrix will have the shape (n_components, n_channels), where:
# # - n_components is the number of independent components
# # - n_channels is the number of sensor channels

# # You can inspect or use the mixing matrix as needed for further analysis or visualization
