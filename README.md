In this repo, you will find the analysis pipeline I am creating to analyze resting-state and Heartbeat Counting Task (HCT) EEG data. 
The steps are as follows: 
  1) Preprocessing
  2) ICA decomposition for artifact cleaning
  3) Computation of Heartbeat-Evoked Potentials (HEP)
  4) Statistical analysis of HEP, longitudinally within subjects and case-control between-subjects

You can track my progress here.
